<p>Hi there! Over the past few days I&rsquo;ve seen people around me struggle with Git. This tutorial is an attempt to get them started in the right direction. This by no means is a complete reference to Git. For a complete reference kindly take a look at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git">Atlassian&rsquo;s Git Tutorial</a>. I&rsquo;ve tried to make this content as easy and comprehensible as possible.</p>

<h5 id="what-is-a-vcs">What is a VCS?</h5>

<p>VCS stands for Version Control System. VCS is a system that records all the modifications done to a file or a project so that developers can recall or refer earlier versions of code (comes in handy if you make a mistake and want to compare earlier versions). There are 2 types of VCSs - Central and Distributed. Central systems have one copy of your project on a server and you commit directly to the central copy. Distributed systems have various copies stored on different machines local to developers rather than one central server.</p>

<h5 id="what-is-git">What is Git?</h5>

<p>Git is a type of distributed VCS. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Developers use Git to keep a track of all the stages that the project goes through to attain it&rsquo;s current state. It&rsquo;s one of the most powerful VCS out there with tons of different features. So how does one get started with Git. Well the first step will be to install Git on your system. For this particular tutorial I&rsquo;ll be using <a href="https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/">visualize-git</a>. I suggest you do the same and follow along. I find in particularly useful for learning purposes because it removes all the hassle of installing Git on your system and moreover you&rsquo;ll be able to visualize your whole work flow.</p>

<h5 id="commit-early-commit-often">Commit early, commit often</h5>

<p>A commit in a Git repository records a snapshot of all the files in your directory. Whenever you commit changes in a Git repository, Git stores all the changes you&rsquo;ve made and stores them as a commit. It doesn&rsquo;t just blindly copy the entire directory but is very smart about keeping track of the set of changes you make. It also maintains a hierarchy of all the commits you make i.e. each commit will have a parent commit. This way you can keep track of the history of changes you&rsquo;ve made.</p>

<p>Commiting any change in Git is a two part process. First part includes pushing the changes to a staging area. Staging area is analogous to a stopped conveyer belt. You keep all the changes that you&rsquo;re going to commit on the conveyer belt before moving them forward. Once you&rsquo;ve added all the changes to the staging area you can commit the changes to move the belt forward.</p>

<p>Staging any change in Git is done by using the command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">git add &lt;filename&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: Unfortunately visualize-git doesn&rsquo;t support the above command. I hope that you&rsquo;ll try the following command on your own in a git repository.</p>

<p>Commiting any staged chages in Git is done using the command (try it on visualize-git)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git commit -m <span style="color:#0ff;font-weight:bold">&#34;YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE&#34;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Whenever you commit, I suggest you provide a meaningful message to describe all the changes that have been done in the commit. This will help you when you go back through history of commits. After commiting here is what your workspace on visualize-git should look like -
